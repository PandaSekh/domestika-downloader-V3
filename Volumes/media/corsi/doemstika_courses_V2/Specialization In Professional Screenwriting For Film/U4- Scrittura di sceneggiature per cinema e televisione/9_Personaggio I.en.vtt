1
00:00:09.104 --> 00:00:12.454
In this lesson. i'll talk to you about the character
and their different roles

2
00:00:12.892 --> 00:00:14.932
in the narrative we are writing.

3
00:00:15.656 --> 00:00:19.992
The character has its complexities... And sometimes one
makes mistakes and assumes that

4
00:00:20.398 --> 00:00:27.225
Only one character is performing a recognition path in
an altered territory. going from one point to another.

5
00:00:27.225 --> 00:00:31.798
Often we assume that the character merely experiences
these changes without truly understanding or reacting

6
00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:37.978
crosses a transformed landscape to evolve and will
sustain that evolution significantly and lastingly. a

7
00:00:37.978 --> 00:00:42.614
element of the narrative. We also believe the character
is deeply intertwined with the plot. reflecting the

8
00:00:43.402 --> 00:00:48.976
returns to the three-act setup and at some point falls
into maximum disturbance territories. This is true.

9
00:00:48.976 --> 00:00:54.657
but there is a foundational error here. The character
we see at the beginning. a boy with a viewpoint. named

10
00:00:54.657 --> 00:00:56.235
Eduardo...

11
00:00:56.235 --> 00:00:58.200
is really not alone.

12
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.915
The character shares more than just a viewpoint.

13
00:01:02.451 --> 00:01:07.581
the narrative includes other Ns. each following their
own developmental journeys. adding layers to the story.

14
00:01:08.779 --> 00:01:12.255
but if one expands the character. it reveals hidden
layers.

15
00:01:12.824 --> 00:01:15.554
it can have hidden characters and hidden plots.

16
00:01:16.646 --> 00:01:21.824
the character holds many facets. and if a scriptwriter
fails to understand this. they encounter numerous

17
00:01:22.585 --> 00:01:24.042
they get into many problems.

18
00:01:24.477 --> 00:01:25.622
The characters

19
00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:32.958
They typically adopt various roles where each role
transforms them into an entirely distinct character

20
00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:39.116
the narrative context. For instance. eduardo might
portray a negligent son. then switch to embodying a

21
00:01:39.116 --> 00:01:40.384
devoted husband. or simply become the friendly
neighborhood neighbor.

22
00:01:40.384 --> 00:01:46.033
Eduardo in our narrative could either be a secretive
spy or a passionate lover. We'll examine both

23
00:01:46.033 --> 00:01:52.029
possibilities closely. In terms of being a bad son.
consider this: when Eduardo's father lies ill in the

24
00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:53.701
hospital. eduardo neglects to visit him or offer any
support.

25
00:01:53.701 --> 00:01:57.542
has poor communication with him. And that role of...

26
00:01:57.875 --> 00:02:00.071
our character Eduardo slash

27
00:02:00.516 --> 00:02:09.032
Bad son... This reputation will haunt him like a curse
throughout the arc of our story. At the very least. we

28
00:02:09.032 --> 00:02:10.830
will ensure that his character development is
compelling.

29
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.486
whenever we depict a character's role. like Eduardo
Malijo. there are always moments where a value shift

30
00:02:17.486 --> 00:02:22.030
occurs along that journey. In Eduardo's role. these
shifts are crucial for his character development.

31
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.356
In our story. we'll include every scene where the
husband takes up this particular role. Alongside those

32
00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:34.561
scenes. we'll track shifts in value throughout his
journey. This approach applies equally to instances

33
00:02:34.561 --> 00:02:38.029
involving N1 or Eduardo. his neighbor. We'll capture
all interactions between them. showcasing how each

34
00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:44.674
Each role's arc is crucial. A screenwriter must grasp
this. Every character creates its own arc. shaping

35
00:02:44.674 --> 00:02:44.866
their journey and development.

36
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.770
and you must follow the arc to the end. with value
changes in each of its paths.

37
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:57.011
We also have Eduardo Spy. placed in a circle as he
holds the main role in the film or script we're

38
00:02:57.011 --> 00:03:03.795
This is a spy movie. with Eduardo as the central
character. and we focus on his main arc and the shifts

39
00:03:03.795 --> 00:03:08.211
value it undergoes. His role is pivotal. and the
narrative revolves around his journey. highlighting the

40
00:03:08.211 --> 00:03:12.721
For instance. a lover might be a chess player. or a
radio operator—whatever the role.

41
00:03:13.353 --> 00:03:17.568
radio operator—whatever. The intuition regarding drama

42
00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:24.927
The viewer. every time they encounter the character in
a specific role. feels assured of continuity in that

43
00:03:24.927 --> 00:03:30.528
role’s development. This sense is heightened because
it's highly uncommon to witness someone with such a

44
00:03:31.305 --> 00:03:36.895
where that event is isolated and lost. Typically. those
paths are small arcs to the end.

45
00:03:37.822 --> 00:03:42.992
they follow small arcs to their conclusion. Once we
define the characters' roles. we truly have the

46
00:03:42.992 --> 00:03:43.463
foundation for our narrative.

47
00:03:44.321 --> 00:03:47.854
We genuinely have the foundation to craft our narrative
and build our story.

48
00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:54.969
I believe the key tools for constructing in a truly
healthy manner involve outlining characters and their

49
00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.252
and creatively a story. And to avoid getting into
trouble and tangles.

50
00:04:01.035 --> 00:04:07.278
is to define each character and all the roles they can
derive. then extract their arcs. For instance.

51
00:04:07.278 --> 00:04:09.690
consider 'The Shining' as an example of this process.

52
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.712
Jack Torrance embodies multiple roles: writer. husband.
caretaker. and father. Yet. it's his new. red-hued

53
00:04:15.712 --> 00:04:20.315
personality that captivates us most. This
transformation is the focal point of interest in his

54
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.650
But we have arcs for writer. husband. caretaker.

55
00:04:24.701 --> 00:04:26.712
and father. It's not a single character.

56
00:04:27.636 --> 00:04:34.889
There are five roles. In Kieślowski's 'Blue'. julie.
the main character. loses her family in a tragic car

57
00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:35.580
crash. altering her life's path.

58
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:43.553
is devastated. and we observe four roles in the film:
Yuli as a mother. wife. woman. and composer. Each role

59
00:04:43.553 --> 00:04:50.875
has its own arc. with the central arc focusing on
Juli's attempt to resolve her issue with a lover who is

60
00:04:51.052 --> 00:04:54.666
her issue with a lover who is also a composer.

61
00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:01.269
In 'The Favourite'. she is the central figure with four
distinct roles. She serves as a servant and

62
00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:07.370
lady-in-waiting. becomes the queen's lover. takes on
the role of a wife. and acts as a confidante and

63
00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.733
advisor. with this last role being her primary one.

64
00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:15.881
Thelma from 'Thelma & Louise' is a wife. friend.
robber. lover. and revenger. Her journey encompasses

65
00:05:15.881 --> 00:05:17.347
roles. culminating in her quest for revenge.

66
00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:22.035
Marina Vidal. from ‘A Fantastic Woman’. is a singer and
waitress.

67
00:05:22.662 --> 00:05:24.778
fiancée and friend. The viewer.

68
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.625
and is under suspicion. These last two roles are the
most significant.

69
00:05:29.437 --> 00:05:36.430
In 'Get Out'. chris Washington is a boyfriend.
photographer. and patient. central to this chilling

70
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:42.702
each of them then stopped being a character and cloned
themselves. The cloning of characters' roles.

71
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.495
it's a task that must be initiated from the start and
completed thoroughly.

72
00:05:47.875 --> 00:05:53.378
This technique greatly simplifies the process of
writing scripts. In stories featuring three characters.

73
00:05:53.378 --> 00:05:58.419
every character is duplicated for different roles.
managing multiple story arcs becomes essential.

74
00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:03.049
Consequently. dealing with this substantial number of
arcs requires careful organization and planning.

75
00:06:03.049 --> 00:06:09.916
Each character has its own scenes. and it's a task for
the screenwriter. The screenwriter's sole job is to

76
00:06:09.916 --> 00:06:12.702
ensure each character's arc is closed. This is crucial
for maintaining the story's coherence and structure.

77
00:06:13.114 --> 00:06:18.348
each character's arc remains open. They achieve it. and
it completes the film's structure.

78
00:06:19.055 --> 00:06:24.608
Once we have this. we can delve into various character
classifications. The character is not isolated; they

79
00:06:24.608 --> 00:06:27.827
are surrounded by other characters. each contributing
to the narrative.

80
00:06:27.827 --> 00:06:29.577
Like a cell that requires

81
00:06:30.401 --> 00:06:35.241
DNA gives instructions. a molecule provides nutrition.
Another cell aids reproduction.

82
00:06:35.543 --> 00:06:37.020
for reproduction.

83
00:06:37.532 --> 00:06:43.160
Another cell offers organelles for movement. A
different cell links it to the outside world. Through

84
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:49.239
instruction. communication. locomotion. reproduction.
and nourishment. these essential components are vital.

85
00:06:49.239 --> 00:06:53.180
Just like in human societies. each has a core figure or
function which will be explored further.

86
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:59.197
This character requires external support in various
forms: being informed. engaging in communication.

87
00:06:59.197 --> 00:07:05.512
experiencing movement. receiving care. and
participating in interactions or seeking sexual

88
00:07:05.512 --> 00:07:10.160
depend on a tangible world. real people. or
technological enhancements to fulfill these needs.

89
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:16.390
And here once more. we delve into the triangle of
script construction and observe how each role within it

90
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:22.105
be substituted with an implant. a physical entity from
our world. or another defined role. The myths

91
00:07:22.105 --> 00:07:25.021
associated with this framework allocate specific labels
to every single event in question.

92
00:07:25.161 --> 00:07:31.604
In numerous films. the main character. whether hero or
heroine. is often flanked by a communicator. the

93
00:07:31.604 --> 00:07:37.861
jester. and an instructor. the wizard. This dynamic is
a recurring theme. highlighting the importance of

94
00:07:37.861 --> 00:07:43.681
by a person who loves or is loved. the beloved or the
lover. by someone who captivates with a sensory snare.

95
00:07:43.681 --> 00:07:49.070
the sorcerer or sorceress. and with someone who appears
to be the leader of an army or with a figure

96
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:52.830
army. embodying movement's essence. attributes present
in the narrative.

97
00:07:53.779 --> 00:07:57.529
Each one is part of a movie. One can watch any movie
and see which character is which.

98
00:07:58.188 --> 00:08:05.566
you can identify which character is a wizard. a jester.
a sorcerer. a lover. or an army captain. forming a

99
00:08:05.566 --> 00:08:07.098
unique group dynamic within the narrative.

100
00:08:07.922 --> 00:08:13.570
The functional element encircling the protagonist can
also serve to craft antagonistic factions. as

101
00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:16.594
illustrated in this image. This tool is versatile in
shaping narrative dynamics.

102
00:08:16.594 --> 00:08:21.576
We observe the identical image duplicated on both
sides. with one side featuring a protagonist or

103
00:08:21.576 --> 00:08:27.174
protagonistine. while the other displays an antagonist
or antagonistine. each accompanied by their respective

104
00:08:27.174 --> 00:08:32.464
group of characters. Let's explore how these
elements—character clones and mythic roles—can be

105
00:08:32.464 --> 00:08:33.749
within our script folder.

106
00:08:34.767 --> 00:08:40.255
Let's revisit the script folder and delve into the
characters of the story. In Miguel's roles. we find

107
00:08:40.255 --> 00:08:42.666
he is a thesis student. Miguel's character is central
to the narrative.

108
00:08:43.359 --> 00:08:50.559
Miguel is a biologist. a friend. an ex-boyfriend. and a
patient. embodying multiple roles in the narrative.

109
00:08:50.802 --> 00:08:54.781
Miguel plays a role of being unusually at ease with
Antonia in the narrative.

110
00:08:55.189 --> 00:09:01.603
Miguel is Antonia's friend and Miguel is a son. We have
1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8 roles.

111
00:09:02.412 --> 00:09:04.390
only in the character of Miguel.

112
00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:09.777
Every character will be duplicated in their respective
roles. This task must be completed within the script

113
00:09:09.777 --> 00:09:10.372
folder.

114
00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:14.797
It's not necessary to do this with all the characters.
but as we progress.

115
00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:21.087
In the work folder. it's essential to address each main
character and perform the same task. This will ensure

116
00:09:21.087 --> 00:09:22.156
consistency in their roles.

117
00:09:22.783 --> 00:09:26.657
Let's explore the roles of myths within our narrative
framework.

118
00:09:26.987 --> 00:09:32.761
The wizard in our story is Jara. 50 years old. miguel's
thesis advisor for his postgraduate studies. The

119
00:09:32.761 --> 00:09:38.647
captain of Miguel's group in the army is Margaret. 30.
his lifelong friend. who is incredibly athletic and

120
00:09:38.647 --> 00:09:40.147
loves soccer.

121
00:09:40.147 --> 00:09:42.637
The sorcerer or sorceress in the life of...

122
00:09:43.899 --> 00:09:44.756
Michael.

123
00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:47.389
is Lidia. age 30. his ex.

124
00:09:48.284 --> 00:09:52.174
that ensnares him nearly always. keeping him trapped in
a sort of perpetual confinement.

125
00:09:53.407 --> 00:09:59.197
In Miguel's life. antonia is the beloved from whom he
cannot escape. caught in an inescapable web.

126
00:10:00.981 --> 00:10:02.478
main players

127
00:10:03.489 --> 00:10:05.921
The jester. It's Caco. his university mate.

128
00:10:07.005 --> 00:10:08.262
in other systems.

129
00:10:09.087 --> 00:10:13.769
At the flight center. captain Douglas Connery. the
wizard. ensures a calm. anxiety-free experience.

130
00:10:14.306 --> 00:10:15.331
An ex.

131
00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:23.050
Meet a former decadent airplane pilot who has found a
new calling teaching at the same institute where he

132
00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:28.036
once flew with anxiety. Amelia Houston. the visionary
founder and owner of the Fly Without Anxiety Center.

133
00:10:28.336 --> 00:10:33.088
Dr. Mercado. amelia Houston’s psychologist partner. is
the sorcerer in this scenario.

134
00:10:34.291 --> 00:10:41.647
Amelia Houston adores the flight simulator. having
invested her funds into its expansive cockpit. complete

135
00:10:41.647 --> 00:10:42.341
with blue screens on the sides.

136
00:10:43.216 --> 00:10:48.417
The cockpit features blue screens on the sides. The
fool at the flight center is Patricia. the amusing

137
00:10:49.165 --> 00:10:52.759
the amusing flight attendant and assistant to Amelia
Houston.

138
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:54.795
We can use

139
00:10:55.108 --> 00:10:57.033
this myth cluster

140
00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.583
in characters within systems

141
00:10:59.955 --> 00:11:03.177
surrounding institutions. They help construct
characters

142
00:11:03.816 --> 00:11:06.194
and establish how many actually

143
00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.865
are the ones involved in the narrative.

144
00:11:09.189 --> 00:11:11.449
Now. in the next lesson. we will delve into characters
further.
