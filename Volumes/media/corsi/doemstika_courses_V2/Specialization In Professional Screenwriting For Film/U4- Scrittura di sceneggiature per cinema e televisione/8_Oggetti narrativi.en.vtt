00:00:09.035 --> 00:00:14.325
In this lesson. i'll discuss implants and the
interaction of objects with script elements in detail.

2
00:00:17.173 --> 00:00:20.733
Let's recall that a script system has a physical
universe characters

3
00:00:21.493 --> 00:00:29.005
Implants and lines of action moving back and forth
create coherence in the system. These implants

4
00:00:29.005 --> 00:00:34.411
the third crucial element in our narrative triangle.
following established patterns to ensure unity and

5
00:00:34.411 --> 00:00:40.021
Classifying small objects manipulable by the character.
But why focus on small objects specifically?

6
00:00:40.708 --> 00:00:47.076
If a character could fit inside an implant. it would
meet the criteria of the physical universe's structure.

7
00:00:47.875 --> 00:00:51.211
the implant by default needs to be handled. An implant

8
00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:58.322
It's named so because it's linked with a system. This
associated element functions differently than expected.

9
00:00:58.322 --> 00:01:04.369
A lamp. for instance. is part of the physical universe.
However. when it becomes an implant. it serves a

10
00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.288
distinct purpose. The lamp remains a lamp in the
physical realm. but as an implant. its role shifts.

11
00:01:06.288 --> 00:01:09.597
it is used as a weapon. If the lamp is merely a lamp

12
00:01:10.247 --> 00:01:15.029
It's part of a physical universe. With that difference
clear. let's begin analyzing the types of implants

13
00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:18.992
we're going to encounter in any narrative and that you
will find in your story.

14
00:01:19.872 --> 00:01:26.538
Implant devices are classified based on their function.
They serve as tangible carriers of various types of

15
00:01:26.538 --> 00:01:33.017
data. whether it's a secure folder concealing sensitive
details or an entry key for restricted access to

16
00:01:33.017 --> 00:01:39.621
buildings like hotels or rooms locked with secrets
inside. Such objects play crucial roles in safeguarding

17
00:01:39.621 --> 00:01:40.182
and revealing information.

18
00:01:40.182 --> 00:01:43.692
It could be a clue under a book on the table where this

19
00:01:44.306 --> 00:01:46.564
implant indicates someone was there.

20
00:01:47.363 --> 00:01:52.975
Implants are integral to the narrative. not just
accessories; they construct the storyline. Without

21
00:01:52.975 --> 00:01:58.213
narrative elements. stories lose their essence and
cease functioning properly. Most films begin by

22
00:01:58.213 --> 00:02:00.619
establishing such crucial components.

23
00:02:00.878 --> 00:02:03.567
and continue. New plots are created

24
00:02:04.801 --> 00:02:07.879
due to the presence of these small objects that go

25
00:02:08.863 --> 00:02:15.695
invisibly advancing the narrative. Consider the choice
between the blue pill and the red pill in The Matrix.

26
00:02:15.695 --> 00:02:21.073
where a single decision leads to a completely different
journey. These elements are pivotal. guiding the

27
00:02:21.834 --> 00:02:24.046
Implants... Come in various types.

28
00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.244
Let's examine each one in depth. Character-building
implants help shape an individual and define them.

29
00:02:30.244 --> 00:02:36.037
Metaphor implants. suspense implants. future implants.
functional or discovery implants. and central ones.

30
00:02:36.037 --> 00:02:37.240
Let's explore each.

31
00:02:37.653 --> 00:02:44.829
For the future. we will have functional or discovery
implants. and central ones. Let's examine each type

32
00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:49.935
individually. A character-building implant: we've
encountered this concept frequently in films.

33
00:02:50.685 --> 00:02:57.298
They are narrative objects so intricately linked to the
central character in a one-to-one correspondence.

34
00:02:57.298 --> 00:03:03.219
making them instantly recognizable symbols of their
owner’s presence. A hat or whip. for instance.

35
00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:09.690
This mask signals a villainous character. possibly one
who is imprisoned. making it instantly recognizable as

36
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:10.997
part of their narrative identity.

37
00:03:11.305 --> 00:03:17.028
a character voyaging in a spaceship or one soon to face
a battle. These scenarios set the stage for

38
00:03:17.585 --> 00:03:23.930
The helmets of characters are not just protective gear;
they are unique identifiers. Yet. to truly stand out.

39
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.635
they require a distinctive feature. A standard helmet
simply won't suffice in this context. as it must

40
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:37.543
The second kind of character-building implant is either
supportive or communicational. Typically. these

41
00:03:37.543 --> 00:03:41.662
include items like cigarettes. liquor glasses.
spectacles. or any type of pen that the character uses.

42
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.178
that the character manipulates

43
00:03:45.076 --> 00:03:50.473
the implant. directing their communication through it
to ensure seamless interaction.

44
00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:55.965
to another person via the implant. This communication
flow would be seamless. enhancing interaction and

45
00:03:56.646 --> 00:03:57.576
character

46
00:03:58.336 --> 00:03:59.966
implant character

47
00:04:00.736 --> 00:04:09.764
I pick up this object. and as I talk to you. i gaze at
it. It's transformed; it's not merely an object

48
00:04:09.764 --> 00:04:11.181
anymore. It has transcended being just a magnifying
glass.

49
00:04:11.181 --> 00:04:14.311
and it becomes a communication pathway implant.

50
00:04:14.648 --> 00:04:19.728
are present in many films and characterize many
characters. To become an implant

51
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.229
must have this attribute. At least it must.

52
00:04:23.702 --> 00:04:30.379
exposed more than once or twice. A functional implant
transforms an ordinary object. like a shoe. into a

53
00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:33.462
lethal weapon. altering its purpose beyond its original
design.

54
00:04:33.462 --> 00:04:40.164
In movies. we often see characters use objects in ways
completely different from their intended purpose to

55
00:04:40.164 --> 00:04:46.994
solve problems or escape difficult situations. This
innovative approach to familiar items serves as a

56
00:04:46.994 --> 00:04:47.184
for developing the characters' resourcefulness and
creativity.

57
00:04:47.926 --> 00:04:54.196
And finally. we see accessory implants. which are among
the most recognizable types of implants. These

58
00:04:54.196 --> 00:05:00.529
include items such as rings. various types of hats. and
even a conspicuous hearing aid that adds to the

59
00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:04.095
character’s identity every time they wear it. Such
accessories serve not only as identifiers but also

60
00:05:04.445 --> 00:05:09.803
The four types of character-building implants are
communicational. support. functional. and accessories.

61
00:05:09.803 --> 00:05:14.000
consistently incorporate them when crafting my stories.
enhancing depth and engagement.

62
00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:20.967
The metaphor implant is an implant that creates a
symbolic connection to the conflict or some part of the

63
00:05:20.967 --> 00:05:26.819
story. For example. the top or spinner in Inception.
which somehow represents time.

64
00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:32.950
present or exiting the dream world. Metaphorical
implants. such as when an egg symbolizes the soul. like

65
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:38.909
Angel Heart. are common. These implants often carry
significant metaphorical weight. adding depth to the

66
00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:39.884
narrative and enriching the story's symbolic layers.

67
00:05:39.884 --> 00:05:43.730
like the cracked glass representing infidelity.

68
00:05:44.556 --> 00:05:50.960
a cut flower symbolizing the loss of innocence. part of
a cultural narrative linking objects to significant

69
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:57.125
life transitions. Yet. the screenwriter picks the most
refined instance of these tropes and weaves them

70
00:05:57.125 --> 00:05:59.579
seamlessly into the story. enhancing its elegance and
coherence.

71
00:06:00.401 --> 00:06:03.587
in the narrative. Suspense-generating implant.

72
00:06:04.018 --> 00:06:10.975
This implant generates tension through anticipation
because of foreknowledge about impending danger or

73
00:06:10.975 --> 00:06:16.365
disturbance. In "Alien." for instance. a character
discovers the alien's skin. heightening suspense and

74
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.006
and examines it. We then know solely by that object

75
00:06:20.554 --> 00:06:26.926
that the predator is in close proximity. This heightens
tension for the audience. Suspense generators are

76
00:06:26.926 --> 00:06:32.753
crucial for crafting atmosphere and are particularly
sought after in thrillers. as they effectively build

77
00:06:32.753 --> 00:06:39.329
at key moments to build dramatic tension... As the
character approaches danger. Narrative future generator

78
00:06:39.329 --> 00:06:45.286
implant. It's any object containing a mystery within.

79
00:06:45.286 --> 00:06:51.084
and the presence of the implant creates an expectation
of a future situation because we don't know what's

80
00:06:51.084 --> 00:06:53.293
going to happen with it. It's an extraterrestrial
object

81
00:06:54.428 --> 00:07:00.676
It could be an enigmatic party invitation or a medical
report suggesting a test needs repeating. Any of these

82
00:07:00.676 --> 00:07:02.626
items transform into a narrative. adding depth.

83
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:09.771
are no longer merely a box or a medical report; they
transform into a narrative. adding depth and intrigue.

84
00:07:10.878 --> 00:07:16.647
which immediately generates a projection towards the
future of the story. Discovery implants are the objects

85
00:07:16.647 --> 00:07:22.471
that an investigator follows to uncover the truth and
reach the core of their quest. These implants guide the

86
00:07:22.471 --> 00:07:24.715
discovery process.

87
00:07:24.715 --> 00:07:28.659
to the truth by clues or causal associations and are
clues.

88
00:07:29.546 --> 00:07:35.184
photographs. cigarette traces have been lit. for
example. in Seven. behind the refrigerator.

89
00:07:35.844 --> 00:07:41.448
Researchers discover three plastic chips that link to
the next clue. allowing one to map out the movie's

90
00:07:41.448 --> 00:07:47.268
clues by tracking all the discovery implants. These
implants guide the investigator to uncover the truth

91
00:07:47.268 --> 00:07:48.346
reach the core of their quest. following clues or
causal associations.

92
00:07:49.357 --> 00:07:52.589
interruptions to that logical line of implant to
implant

93
00:07:53.267 --> 00:07:59.313
which are script errors. or one can reinforce those
logical lines by incorporating new discovery implants.

94
00:07:59.313 --> 00:08:01.477
Blade Runner. the protagonist finds a photo and
enhances it.

95
00:08:02.181 --> 00:08:06.251
The hero discovers an old photo and uses technology to
enlarge it.

96
00:08:08.739 --> 00:08:13.211
until he reaches what he wants to see. which will
connect him to the next clue

97
00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:16.965
What are the characteristics of a snake's scales?

98
00:08:17.463 --> 00:08:23.670
In a bathtub. note that discovery implants alone aren't
sufficient as proof. They're merely steps on the

99
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:29.102
journey toward uncovering the whole truth. Now we've
hit the phase where it's like reaching mad goofing or

100
00:08:29.152 --> 00:08:35.515
The implant becomes a focal point of the narrative.
drawing all attention and energy towards it until the

101
00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:42.000
actual significance of the physical item diminishes
entirely. It transforms into an insignificance. serving

102
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.303
merely as a vessel for heightened drama. The core
mystery lies in deciphering what resides within that

103
00:08:46.303 --> 00:08:52.134
Understanding the exact purpose of an implant becomes
less crucial than its impact and the emotional

104
00:08:52.134 --> 00:08:58.316
investment tied to it. A perfect illustration is the
mysterious glowing briefcase in "Pulp Fiction." which

105
00:08:58.316 --> 00:09:00.708
captivates audiences with its enigmatic power and
significance.

106
00:09:00.708 --> 00:09:06.600
As observed. throughout a film's journey or my
narrative path. for example. there are various events

107
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.548
the character faces antagonists. conflicts with
themselves. and encounters toxic elements.

108
00:09:10.548 --> 00:09:16.010
with oneself in their conflicts. tackling noxious
elements. and dealing with intrusive implants. These

109
00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:21.526
devices offer insights into the film’s core inquiries.
Within the script’s framework. we have explored this

110
00:09:21.526 --> 00:09:27.291
Characters. objects. and implants are crucial elements
in our narrative. With a thoroughly prepared folder.

111
00:09:27.291 --> 00:09:32.573
crafting the script will be seamless. Now. let’s
examine our story’s characters. objects. and implants

112
00:09:32.573 --> 00:09:34.963
filled and corrected daily.

113
00:09:35.942 --> 00:09:40.538
We open the topic of historical objects and prints. and
I've divided them.

114
00:09:41.154 --> 00:09:47.181
and I recommend you do the same with characters. The
objects and implants from Miguel's world. those from

115
00:09:47.181 --> 00:09:53.324
Antonia's world. and the ones from the Anxiety-Free
Flying Therapy Center. bSA. These elements are integral

116
00:09:53.324 --> 00:09:56.252
to the story. enriching the narrative and providing
depth to the characters' experiences and interactions.

117
00:09:56.362 --> 00:10:01.956
In Miguel's lab. there are petri dishes housing various
strains of troublesome bacteria and bacterial

118
00:10:01.956 --> 00:10:07.994
cultures on agar plates that have plagued him greatly.
He frequently employs a stress-relief ball provided to

119
00:10:07.994 --> 00:10:08.992
help manage his mounting tension.

120
00:10:09.622 --> 00:10:11.372
We have a scene where

121
00:10:11.682 --> 00:10:18.486
Antonia's aunt hands the protagonist a jar containing
deceased bees for examination. Throughout much of the

122
00:10:18.486 --> 00:10:24.654
film. he is shown carrying and contemplating this jar.
which gradually transforms into a symbolic

123
00:10:24.654 --> 00:10:26.817
representation of an implanted object within him.

124
00:10:26.817 --> 00:10:32.883
In Antonia's realm. she faces the task of parting with
her childhood CD collection. either by giving them

125
00:10:32.883 --> 00:10:39.181
away or discarding them. Additionally. the Nimbus 2000
broom from Harry Potter. which she has owned since age

126
00:10:39.181 --> 00:10:40.337
13. is also on the list of items that must be sold.

127
00:10:40.337 --> 00:10:45.106
The audio guides that the protagonists must listen to
every night. provided by the therapy center. discuss

128
00:10:45.106 --> 00:10:46.546
topics like

129
00:10:47.175 --> 00:10:53.225
why a plane won't crash from one engine failure. what
occurs during turbulence? Why is flying considered

130
00:10:53.225 --> 00:10:57.124
safer than driving? Those audio guides they listen to
every night

131
00:10:57.124 --> 00:11:02.893
always become a link between the characters. evolving
into implants that connect them both in unexpected

132
00:11:03.592 --> 00:11:08.923
In the realm of the anxiety-free flying center. we find
anxiety-free flying pins or badges. anxiety-free

133
00:11:08.923 --> 00:11:14.049
flying mugs. and all the other quirky items associated
with this unique center. The fact that I only

134
00:11:14.049 --> 00:11:15.792
mentioned these examples indicates I haven't yet fully
developed the story.

135
00:11:15.792 --> 00:11:18.902
This suggests that I have not put in sufficient effort

136
00:11:19.926 --> 00:11:25.815
as I ponder the story over time. fresh insights will
surface. adding depth to the narrative. Reflecting

137
00:11:25.815 --> 00:11:27.016
daily. new elements will naturally emerge.

138
00:11:27.585 --> 00:11:30.125
more implants will surface in my mind

139
00:11:30.745 --> 00:11:37.068
and additional narrative elements that I will need to
create. find. or somehow uncover in the process of

140
00:11:37.068 --> 00:11:37.555
exploration.

141
00:11:38.287 --> 00:11:42.578
a systematic review through the script folder. I showed
these as examples and

142
00:11:42.948 --> 00:11:47.747
Every day. as the course advances. i'll complete them.
Once you can access this folder. located in an annex.

143
00:11:47.747 --> 00:11:52.547
it will be filled with all the movie's implants.
Naturally. some implants align better with specific

144
00:11:52.547 --> 00:11:55.392
while others are more peculiar. like the ear in
Cronenberg's The Fly.

145
00:11:56.032 --> 00:11:59.122
A bloody knife is irrelevant to my narrative's core
elements.

146
00:11:59.482 --> 00:12:01.552
some implants are far more

147
00:12:02.636 --> 00:12:09.962
strange. like in The Nose. Or consider the ear in
Cronenberg's The Fly. an exceptionally peculiar

148
00:12:10.082 --> 00:12:16.647
Biological. fitting solely within Cronenberg's
universe. Each tale contains its unique set of

149
00:12:16.647 --> 00:12:16.839
adding to the narrative's depth.

150
00:12:17.286 --> 00:12:23.312
However. it's incorrect to directly associate a
specific implant type with a particular story type

151
00:12:23.312 --> 00:12:25.586
the combinations of characters and objects are
virtually limitless and diverse.

152
00:12:26.254 --> 00:12:31.642
we've seen a physical universe. implants. and in the
next lesson. we'll dive into the world of characters.
