1
00:00:08.956 --> 00:00:12.310
We will now view the base argument. which will be

2
00:00:12.636 --> 00:00:15.668
the core construction hub of our narrative's
foundation.

3
00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:18.273
which is the base argument.

4
00:00:18.643 --> 00:00:25.063
The argument distills the story to its core; it's the
framework. the DNA. the essential structure of a

5
00:00:25.691 --> 00:00:27.918
as we will see here. the base argument

6
00:00:28.575 --> 00:00:32.833
is the DNA. Is it the framework? Is it the internal
structure of the story?

7
00:00:33.472 --> 00:00:38.486
so straightforward that this argument can be expressed
in countless ways. each telling the same core story.

8
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:46.459
An argument serves as a framework. a pattern adaptable
for various narratives. This universality is why

9
00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:49.064
arguments can convey many stories. maintaining the same
essence.

10
00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:55.394
Stories are distinct. Let's delve into the components
that form an argument. exploring how they shape

11
00:00:56.013 --> 00:01:01.345
We have our standard line and scheme. featuring a
notable internal change. This change in the story

12
00:01:01.345 --> 00:01:06.478
certain traits we observed in the previous lesson.
Thus. it could be argued that this transformation is

13
00:01:06.478 --> 00:01:09.170
significant. as it aligns with the characteristics
we've just examined.

14
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.542
That path. which seems like a straight line. really
isn't.

15
00:01:13.284 --> 00:01:20.660
Life's path is quite winding. filled with many ups and
downs. It's like a random journey where we experience

16
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.740
moments of being up and down. moving back and forth
between different points and characters. This iterative

17
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:33.348
where we iterate between one point and another and
between one character and another. For example. here.

18
00:01:33.348 --> 00:01:39.957
have this character who has a friend. then this
character meets others. then this character finds

19
00:01:39.957 --> 00:01:41.316
relevant in an object.

20
00:01:42.397 --> 00:01:44.217
this character encounters an antagonist

21
00:01:44.955 --> 00:01:50.624
This character encounters an individual who could
potentially have significance in his life journey. When

22
00:01:50.624 --> 00:01:56.509
considering how to establish foundational components of
a narrative. there exists a straightforward method to

23
00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:57.913
dissect and understand the core essence of any given
story.

24
00:01:57.913 --> 00:02:05.662
and it is to create symbols for interpreting history.
Universal symbols that enable us to detach history from

25
00:02:05.662 --> 00:02:11.351
any personal involvement or emotional. affective
connection. This approach allows for a clearer

26
00:02:11.351 --> 00:02:13.601
of contamination with our personal history

27
00:02:14.285 --> 00:02:20.695
or other factors that could compromise the essence of
this narrative. We'll employ a series of symbols to

28
00:02:20.695 --> 00:02:21.367
achieve this clarity and detachment.

29
00:02:22.468 --> 00:02:29.168
A screenwriting triangle consists of three vertices.
The first vertex is a character. the second is a

30
00:02:29.168 --> 00:02:33.613
physical universe or environment. and the third is a
tangible component.

31
00:02:33.663 --> 00:02:43.888
and the third vertex represents a tangible component
that encourages engagement. It can be part of a

32
00:02:43.888 --> 00:02:49.892
world such as a home’s bathroom. a warehouse. or even a
vessel. serving as an environment for characters to

33
00:02:49.991 --> 00:02:55.783
any character we've imagined can be represented. along
with physical objects linked to them. These

34
00:02:55.783 --> 00:03:02.049
characters. universes. and objects interact. creating
storytelling possibilities. With just a few symbols.

35
00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.301
any story can unfold. as these elements are crucial for
narrative crafting. allowing for endless creative

36
00:03:05.301 --> 00:03:10.311
one can tell any kind of story. These symbols. which
seem so strange and that we will now explain. are

37
00:03:10.311 --> 00:03:13.407
fundamental in constructing a story.

38
00:03:14.155 --> 00:03:20.614
The first symbol we encounter is that of an armchair or
a couch. This sofa symbol holds significance for me

39
00:03:20.614 --> 00:03:27.193
as it epitomizes a cozy and anticipated space. People
tend to relax on their sofas while watching TV shows or

40
00:03:27.193 --> 00:03:29.186
reading books. which highlights its importance.

41
00:03:29.186 --> 00:03:36.058
A person relaxes on their sofa to feel at ease and at
home. The sofa symbolizes a personal space. creating a

42
00:03:36.058 --> 00:03:38.604
connection to one's own territorial comfort zone.
enhancing that sense of belonging.

43
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.671
On the other hand. there exists a symbol known as The
Box. This box or simple cardboard container serves as a

44
00:03:45.671 --> 00:03:51.635
representation of an awkward or unfamiliar area. acting
like a place of isolation. It is used to convey

45
00:03:51.635 --> 00:03:53.025
feelings of being out of one's element in narratives
such as

46
00:03:53.025 --> 00:03:58.833
There might be a little dog sitting comfortably on an
armchair. but suddenly this dog is blamed for something

47
00:03:58.833 --> 00:04:04.482
and taken out to be put inside a box right in the
middle of the yard. Having that poor little dog in a

48
00:04:04.482 --> 00:04:08.160
exposed to rain in the yard is completely different
from being inside where it’s cozy and dry.

49
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:14.058
When it's raining outside. the armchair inside the
house becomes a sanctuary from the storm. These are two

50
00:04:14.058 --> 00:04:20.013
distinct environments that form one vertex in our
narrative map. alongside another representing

51
00:04:20.013 --> 00:04:26.078
For this latter vertex. i focus on just three elements:
the protagonist or someone closely connected to them.

52
00:04:26.078 --> 00:04:28.082
forming a network of relationships and settings that
enrich the story's texture.

53
00:04:28.082 --> 00:04:34.168
The ally of the protagonist and the antagonist of the
same protagonist are key characters. Alongside them.

54
00:04:34.168 --> 00:04:39.967
objects form the third crucial element. To illustrate
various scenarios. i utilize these three potent

55
00:04:39.967 --> 00:04:43.298
components: for instance. a shattered vase symbolizes
the repercussions of certain actions.

56
00:04:43.424 --> 00:04:49.867
a dagger pointing towards an uncertain but defined
future. and a key unlocking doors of opportunity. These

57
00:04:49.867 --> 00:04:56.067
symbols can be used to create foundational narratives.
serving as the building blocks for increasingly

58
00:04:56.067 --> 00:04:57.040
intricate storylines. These elements.

59
00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:02.627
for instance. help tell stories like this. Let's tell
this story: Someone on a sofa. the character there. is

60
00:05:02.627 --> 00:05:08.162
ousted by an antagonist. Maybe while the character’s in
the bathroom. upon return. the sofa's taken. or the

61
00:05:08.162 --> 00:05:09.766
antagonist expels him outright. Whatever the case. he's
no longer on his sofa

62
00:05:09.766 --> 00:05:15.103
for example. to the bathroom. and upon returning. found
the sofa occupied. He had been expelled and couldn't

63
00:05:15.103 --> 00:05:20.786
return. or the antagonist directly expelled him.
Whatever the event. the character is no longer on his

64
00:05:20.866 --> 00:05:27.343
and has been thrown into another situation of exile
where we find the character in a box. This character in

65
00:05:27.343 --> 00:05:33.761
box. out of their environment. meets an ally who
becomes not just a companion but a confidant. Together

66
00:05:33.761 --> 00:05:38.872
adapt to the confined space. learning its intricacies
and forming a bond that transcends their isolated

67
00:05:38.872 --> 00:05:45.762
Characters often forget they're on a couch until an
event jolts them awake from their comfortable routine.

68
00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:48.102
This sudden change forces them to confront a new
reality. breaking the monotony.

69
00:05:48.828 --> 00:05:55.178
Living in the box. the character decides to reclaim the
armchair. With an ally and equipped with items like a

70
00:05:55.178 --> 00:06:01.528
key. they prepare for the upcoming challenge. Here. we
observe the character who collected these items. ready

71
00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:02.694
to face the future. This marks a significant turning
point in their journey.

72
00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:10.813
and we observe how this character returns to reclaim
their spot on the couch. ousting the antagonist. This

73
00:06:10.813 --> 00:06:16.683
character has just experienced a significant. relevant.
and lasting transformation. This can be seen as a

74
00:06:16.883 --> 00:06:18.721
Monte Cristo can be

75
00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:24.570
The Fugitive can be a series of films. Each of these
elements served to represent the fundamental framework

76
00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:30.052
of a movie. Let's see what other things can be
represented. for example. alien. We've all seen that

77
00:06:30.052 --> 00:06:31.461
Alien.

78
00:06:31.461 --> 00:06:34.251
the crew aboard the space tug Nostromo's vessel

79
00:06:34.748 --> 00:06:40.730
responds to a distress signal and unknowingly brings
aboard a deadly extraterrestrial life form. Now. this

80
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:46.770
story can have three phases. In the first phase. the
chair is the Nostromo ship. where we have the elements

81
00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.044
of the chair. the characters present there.

82
00:06:50.044 --> 00:06:57.230
Characters descend into the box. representing the
planet. where the antagonist awaits. The antagonist

83
00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:00.824
boards the sofa. systematically initiating a sequence
of events that drive the narrative forward.

84
00:07:00.824 --> 00:07:06.726
In the Nostromo ship. symbolized by a chair. the
protagonist must retrieve items like a dagger and a

85
00:07:06.726 --> 00:07:10.324
These elements are crucial as the narrative unfolds.
driving the story forward.

86
00:07:10.324 --> 00:07:16.663
Identify and eliminate the antagonist. then return home
with a significant change. This is a simplified

87
00:07:16.663 --> 00:07:22.203
outline of Alien using these elements. capturing the
essence of the narrative in a concise manner.

88
00:07:22.807 --> 00:07:27.706
I can't stress enough how important it is to tell your
story with these elements. If you can't tell your

89
00:07:27.706 --> 00:07:32.841
story with these elements. you don't understand your
story. If you understand your story with these

90
00:07:32.841 --> 00:07:34.867
you can begin to dress your story.

91
00:07:34.867 --> 00:07:41.833
with increasing complexity. But this is just the first
step. I recommend. as I do myself. that you take any

92
00:07:41.833 --> 00:07:47.888
story and perform this exercise. I will apply this
exercise to my own story and see how it unfolds.

93
00:07:47.888 --> 00:07:51.228
I attempt to depict it in a symbolic manner
consistently.

94
00:07:52.327 --> 00:07:54.125
Symbolically represent then

95
00:07:54.772 --> 00:07:57.934
the story. linking it to the original argument and the
narrative's DNA.

96
00:07:59.334 --> 00:08:01.364
and the DNA of what we're narrating.

97
00:08:02.349 --> 00:08:08.787
This symbolic representation scheme works for three-act
films. phase films. or even experimental films with

98
00:08:08.787 --> 00:08:13.602
non-linear narratives because somehow we need to find a
way to incorporate various structures into our

99
00:08:14.475 --> 00:08:21.234
We can craft narratives using elements like armchairs.
boxes. and vectors. representing any movie type. from

100
00:08:21.234 --> 00:08:21.610
traditional to experimental films.

101
00:08:22.295 --> 00:08:28.349
It's an excellent exercise to watch various films and
use a few elements to play a game of representation.

102
00:08:28.349 --> 00:08:30.520
This helps in understanding the core of different movie
types.

103
00:08:31.271 --> 00:08:37.260
On paper. what might that film resemble? It could offer
a deeper insight into the original arguments. Let's

104
00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:42.970
explore the script folder to see how these concepts are
woven into my narrative. This approach aids in

105
00:08:44.127 --> 00:08:50.199
Let's delve into the core plot of the story now. Here.
i've established that Miguel should be sitting in a

106
00:08:50.199 --> 00:08:56.386
chair as per the narrative setup. However. despite this
clear depiction. there’s an underlying sense that he

107
00:08:56.386 --> 00:09:00.282
actually feels confined within a box instead of being
seated comfortably. He desperately wants to break free

108
00:09:00.342 --> 00:09:06.065
he enters this strange therapeutic center and meets
another person. antonia. who seems. according to him.

109
00:09:06.065 --> 00:09:10.782
be on a couch because she looks very well. preparing
everything for her trip.

110
00:09:10.782 --> 00:09:16.855
He has a slight fear of flying. but he notices she also
appears confined in her own box. Both wonder about

111
00:09:16.855 --> 00:09:17.772
sharing a future. yet she chooses her box.

112
00:09:18.455 --> 00:09:24.050
And both. especially Miguel. start to wonder what it
would be like to be on a couch with her. what it would

113
00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:29.331
be like to be on a future couch with Antonia. But
that's quite unlikely. because that happens in most

114
00:09:29.331 --> 00:09:32.835
romantic comedies. but often it doesn't end well. And
she.

115
00:09:32.835 --> 00:09:38.858
Antonia prefers a familiar box. her life. over a new
couch. which would mean being with her. With him. But

116
00:09:38.858 --> 00:09:42.950
well. it's her choice. In the end. miguel stays in his
box.

117
00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:44.740
which he finds increasingly comfortable.

118
00:09:45.465 --> 00:09:51.173
After multiple reviews. one can almost outline the
story and identify the characters to clarify it. This

119
00:09:51.173 --> 00:09:57.157
forms the DNA of our narrative. and understanding it
helps in grasping the essence of what unfolds.

120
00:09:57.157 --> 00:09:57.761
a clearer picture of the storyline.

121
00:09:57.761 --> 00:09:59.471
this is what our story is about.

122
00:10:00.245 --> 00:10:06.765
This fundamental approach appears remarkably effective
despite its simplicity and apparent triviality. using

123
00:10:06.765 --> 00:10:10.932
everyday objects like an armchair or a box to offer
profound insights into historical contexts.

124
00:10:10.932 --> 00:10:17.695
Stripped of character biases and personal experiences.
it reveals the core truths. It's like an X-ray.

125
00:10:17.695 --> 00:10:19.022
exposing the bare bones of the narrative.

126
00:10:19.667 --> 00:10:21.815
of the story Whenever one arrives

127
00:10:22.619 --> 00:10:27.516
at a story's core with this method. you can know what’s
really being told. Knowing what you narrate is

128
00:10:27.516 --> 00:10:28.909
crucial.

129
00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:33.290
Whenever I miss this detail. i find it difficult to
grasp the full understanding.

130
00:10:33.912 --> 00:10:40.043
Who are the characters. where are they going. and how
do they find themselves at each moment in the script?

131
00:10:40.043 --> 00:10:45.717
If I know a man should be in a chair but actually sits
on a box. i know that man wakes up sad. sits

132
00:10:45.717 --> 00:10:49.156
dissatisfied. and somehow there's an underlying sadness
in everything he does.

133
00:10:49.156 --> 00:10:51.826
a kind of inherent sadness in his actions.

134
00:10:52.532 --> 00:10:55.190
This is one of many examples of understanding this
clearly.

135
00:10:55.802 --> 00:11:00.388
When I do script consulting. i often ask. "Tell me your
story simply. without using names." This helps

136
00:11:00.388 --> 00:11:02.052
clarify the essence of the tale.

137
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:04.380
And tell your story using these...

138
00:11:05.725 --> 00:11:10.778
Iconic figures can't achieve this because they lack
understanding of their own narrative's essence.

139
00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:17.277
But one can take the simple. the objects. and use them
to understand the DNA of the story. Every screenwriter

140
00:11:17.277 --> 00:11:19.890
must understand what the DNA of their story is.

141
00:11:20.571 --> 00:11:24.259
In the next lesson. i'll talk to you about point of
view and narrators. Who tells the story?
