1
00:00:08.728 --> 00:00:12.218
I'll talk about types of stories and how I classify
history.

2
00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:14.487
even before starting to write.

3
00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:17.200
It's important to at least know

4
00:00:17.943 --> 00:00:22.173
Which universe am I referring to when I discuss the
story I'm currently writing about and developing?

5
00:00:22.937 --> 00:00:26.971
classifying the universe of a story in some way makes
you reflect on

6
00:00:27.698 --> 00:00:33.871
What are you writing about? Consider the key elements
essential for developing your project. Reflect on the

7
00:00:34.598 --> 00:00:40.954
As we see here. the story presents itself as a timeline
where our observation highlights that the most

8
00:00:40.954 --> 00:00:47.187
crucial aspect is the substantial and meaningful
transformation experienced by the character at this

9
00:00:47.187 --> 00:00:53.917
journey's end. This significant change in values leaves
us with uncertainty. With my initial concept for the

10
00:00:53.917 --> 00:00:57.221
possible narrative firmly planted. i am now left
wondering: What are the next steps I must take?

11
00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:03.680
How is it classified? Which planet is my story from?
What does it resemble? Which movie or book does it

12
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.512
remind me of? Essentially. we're identifying the key
elements. These elements are unique to this story type

13
00:01:09.512 --> 00:01:10.494
and not others. helping us understand its core.

14
00:01:10.494 --> 00:01:15.881
that are common to this particular type of story and
not to others. For this. there is a vast classification

15
00:01:15.881 --> 00:01:21.268
system for categorizing stories. and I've selected some
for us to play with and start completing our project

16
00:01:21.268 --> 00:01:23.363
folder.

17
00:01:24.075 --> 00:01:29.574
The primary step involves recognizing the existence of
four essential components necessary for categorizing

18
00:01:29.574 --> 00:01:34.765
any narrative. These include aspects tied to reality.
such as how we depict our universe's truth. the

19
00:01:34.765 --> 00:01:39.597
stylistic choices made in world-building. and
considerations regarding character development and

20
00:01:39.597 --> 00:01:44.832
What are the characters' attributes and traits? What's
the narrator's perspective? In other words. who is

21
00:01:44.832 --> 00:01:47.027
actually telling this story? Understanding these
elements is crucial.

22
00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:51.989
Let's delve into all aspects concerning the design of
this narrative first and foremost.

23
00:01:52.721 --> 00:01:57.023
The first thing we need to ask is what kind of
structure does this story have?

24
00:01:57.758 --> 00:02:02.720
We will conduct a private session focusing on
structural elements. examining everything pertinent to

25
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.908
composition and function.

26
00:02:03.523 --> 00:02:09.831
But the key question now is whether this story I'm
about to create can be divided into three acts. If it

27
00:02:09.831 --> 00:02:15.446
it implies there's a beginning. a middle. and an end.
with conflict at its core. This structure guides the

28
00:02:15.466 --> 00:02:21.698
a beginning. a middle. and an end. where conflict is
central. This story could have three major development

29
00:02:21.698 --> 00:02:23.096
phases. each crucial to the narrative's progression.

30
00:02:24.155 --> 00:02:30.747
Or is it a narrative unfolding backwards. slowly
unveiled bit by bit. similar to how one would assemble

31
00:02:30.747 --> 00:02:32.865
or pieces of a puzzle. akin to the way this film may
progress?

32
00:02:35.571 --> 00:02:40.096
Or... It's a story that's so experimental it's very
strange to tell

33
00:02:40.452 --> 00:02:46.214
that cannot be split into three sections. that cannot
be fragmented into particles and moments. but maintains

34
00:02:46.214 --> 00:02:49.122
continuity. like someone filming with a camera.
capturing an unbroken sequence.

35
00:02:49.212 --> 00:02:54.764
Considering an entire sequence plan for a full night.
or specific structures that are quite experimental.

36
00:02:54.764 --> 00:03:00.527
Which of these options do you believe aligns best with
your narrative? I feel the tale I'm crafting follows a

37
00:03:00.527 --> 00:03:04.652
classic three-act structure. and we must determine
which variant suits our story most effectively.

38
00:03:04.652 --> 00:03:12.748
Is this a tale that begins with the protagonist having
little worth. which then dramatically increases by the

39
00:03:12.748 --> 00:03:19.953
conclusion? Alternatively. could it be a narrative
where an initially highly valued individual ends up

40
00:03:19.953 --> 00:03:24.903
Is it a three-act story of gain or a three-act story of
loss? That's the first major classification. which we

41
00:03:24.903 --> 00:03:27.855
could call the structural classification.

42
00:03:28.578 --> 00:03:34.882
which involves design. The next crucial design
classification is the format you'll choose for your

43
00:03:34.882 --> 00:03:36.384
Will it be a documentary. web series. or film?

44
00:03:36.956 --> 00:03:43.091
In what format will this story be defined? Is it a
documentary. a web series. a feature film. a TV movie.

45
00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:49.341
short film. or a series? Each format establishes
distinct characteristics and specific requirements.

46
00:03:49.341 --> 00:03:49.628
will explore in due time.

47
00:03:49.628 --> 00:03:55.218
specific requirements that we will see in due time. But
at least we can know that the story I want to write.

48
00:03:55.218 --> 00:04:00.808
such as making a feature film. aligns with design
principles involving structure and format. Now let's

49
00:04:00.808 --> 00:04:05.571
into the third aspect of this design process. where we
explore further details related to these elements.

50
00:04:05.571 --> 00:04:11.720
The temporal design involves narrating the story
continuously from past to future. reflecting how events

51
00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.258
unfold in reality.

52
00:04:14.325 --> 00:04:20.695
What would be an appropriate manner to describe a
narrative that continues uninterrupted? As mentioned

53
00:04:20.695 --> 00:04:26.771
it could refer to continuous storytelling or starting
from the very beginning. However. is there also a

54
00:04:26.771 --> 00:04:31.786
method where one initially shares part of the tale.
then delves into its middle section before eventually

55
00:04:31.786 --> 00:04:37.488
and there we will grasp the essence of our journey
leading up to that pivotal moment—an altered timeline.

56
00:04:37.488 --> 00:04:43.354
known as in medias res. Alternatively. should we
recount our tale starting solely from its conclusion?

57
00:04:43.354 --> 00:04:46.396
narratives begin at the very end. with the final scene.
encapsulating everything that came before it.

58
00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:55.987
At the start. we explore how we arrived here and trace
back to the story's beginning. This is known as in

59
00:04:55.987 --> 00:05:02.957
extremis narration. Next. we consider the design
related to the narrator or point of view. The narrative

60
00:05:03.157 --> 00:05:08.391
The narrator or point of view can vary in several ways.
A critical aspect to consider is who is actually

61
00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:13.727
narrating the story. There are generally three main
categories: the first being an imaginary figure within

62
00:05:13.727 --> 00:05:15.137
the story.

63
00:05:15.137 --> 00:05:21.041
to be recounted by the character experiencing it. A
protagonist narrator. as seen in this film. The same

64
00:05:21.041 --> 00:05:26.037
narrator who shares the film's story also lives through
the events. You might say. well. this is common in

65
00:05:26.037 --> 00:05:29.087
well. that happens in most films. but it doesn’t. There
are characters where...

66
00:05:31.337 --> 00:05:36.695
it's not about the film's main character; instead. we
have a witness narrator much like Sam as he supports

67
00:05:36.695 --> 00:05:41.750
Frodo throughout his journey in The Lord of the Rings.
Alternatively. my narrative features no clear

68
00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:46.754
protagonist or witness narrator but rather an observer
who compiles the story after all events have

69
00:05:46.754 --> 00:05:46.805
transpired.

70
00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:53.440
Imagine a movie scene where a character uncovers an old
chest. receives a mysterious letter. or just misses

71
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.595
being present when an elderly relative recounts tales
from their youth. serving as a narrator for the

72
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:03.620
The narrative is somehow extracted from the past and
retold through a different perspective or individual.

73
00:06:03.953 --> 00:06:09.495
From one perspective. we might say there's a
protagonist. witness. or archaeologist narrator. Which

74
00:06:09.495 --> 00:06:12.953
your film? It's a choice to consider and decide upon
carefully.

75
00:06:12.953 --> 00:06:15.223
Let's now move on to the world of characters.

76
00:06:16.049 --> 00:06:21.223
A very significant world. In the realm of characters.
we define the conflict that will impact this character

77
00:06:21.223 --> 00:06:23.379
in my story.

78
00:06:24.048 --> 00:06:29.615
You might say. i still don't know because I haven't
started writing about it yet. But it's important to

79
00:06:29.615 --> 00:06:34.718
some intuition about what the main conflict is that
we're likely to find in your character. Is it a

80
00:06:34.718 --> 00:06:40.286
situational conflict? Where. for example. a character
finds themselves trapped in a challenging situation or

81
00:06:40.286 --> 00:06:40.544
struggling against external forces?

82
00:06:40.544 --> 00:06:46.174
hostage. or in an awkward family situation. Is it a
social scenario. perhaps involving societal pressures?

83
00:06:46.803 --> 00:06:54.017
The social conflict involves an individual battling
against societal disparities or feeling endangered by

84
00:06:54.017 --> 00:07:01.094
prevailing norms and structures. This struggle can be
primarily metaphysical. much like the existential

85
00:07:01.094 --> 00:07:03.774
dilemma faced in 'Blade Runner.' where personal fate
intertwines with broader societal issues.

86
00:07:03.774 --> 00:07:09.469
God or who is my creator? Is the main conflict
internal? I mean. is it about a character seemingly

87
00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:15.804
indifferent on the surface but grappling with a
profound identity crisis or an unfulfilled search?

88
00:07:15.804 --> 00:07:18.594
be a relational struggle where one's relationships
reflect deeper existential questions?

89
00:07:18.594 --> 00:07:23.196
for example. one person loves another. but the other
doesn't love back? Or is there a friendship conflict

90
00:07:23.196 --> 00:07:27.667
where one wants to be empathetic. but the other isn't?
Or is it a universe conflict where someone gets

91
00:07:27.667 --> 00:07:29.114
trapped in an elevator

92
00:07:29.114 --> 00:07:34.275
or gets stranded on an island during a tsunami? What's
the central conflict? Another way to examine the

93
00:07:34.275 --> 00:07:39.636
character is through the story's core argument. Every
narrative has a core argument. which we'll explore in

94
00:07:39.636 --> 00:07:44.447
the next lesson. At this stage. we'll understand that
each story presents a fundamental argument that drives

95
00:07:44.447 --> 00:07:50.127
The plot explores a unique world of films. For
instance. it includes narratives where characters aim

96
00:07:50.127 --> 00:07:55.367
invent or construct things and others where they seek
to eliminate obstacles. such as figuratively

97
00:07:55.367 --> 00:08:00.990
like Jaws. killing a monster. killing someone. There's
a plot about traveling and living an adventure. like

98
00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:04.827
Indiana Jones. There are plots related to personal
growth and resolving conflicts.

99
00:08:04.827 --> 00:08:10.749
things just happen and resolve personal issues. Do you
think if you understand things. travel. and resolve

100
00:08:10.749 --> 00:08:16.728
the past like Back to the Future? Or find love? There
are plots where a character goes through their entire

101
00:08:16.728 --> 00:08:17.567
life.

102
00:08:17.567 --> 00:08:23.343
like in Forrest Gump or many biopics. There are plots
where someone violently challenges the status quo. for

103
00:08:23.343 --> 00:08:29.120
example. in The Hunger Games or any movie or narrative
where a hero goes against the system. There are films

104
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.704
where someone seeks revenge as a final motive.

105
00:08:32.704 --> 00:08:38.457
Is it a plot where a mystery is solved. similar to The
Arrival. where we question the strangers' intentions

106
00:08:38.457 --> 00:08:44.104
and message? Whatever the scenario. your film aligns
with a foundational plot. It could involve unraveling

107
00:08:44.104 --> 00:08:49.424
and you don't need to fit into any of these
classifications; you can create your own classification

108
00:08:49.424 --> 00:08:54.795
argument because it's healthy to reflect on what you're
telling yourself. Once we've done that. we return to

109
00:08:54.795 --> 00:09:00.066
the broader context of reality. This vital context
helps us understand the plausibility adjustment of your

110
00:09:00.066 --> 00:09:00.614
film more clearly.

111
00:09:01.471 --> 00:09:03.566
Let’s move now to reality. Um...

112
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:09.917
a crucial aspect of storytelling. In reality. we must
assess the context where our film takes place. There

113
00:09:09.917 --> 00:09:14.944
are three main film contexts: a public world context.
like Rocky. where events are widely known. a private

114
00:09:14.944 --> 00:09:16.841
world context. and a secret bubble context.

115
00:09:16.841 --> 00:09:23.110
where there's a fight. and if this movie were real.
we'd have heard about it on TV and the news. It's a

116
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:29.321
that goes beyond the private realm and transcends. like
an asteroid heading for Earth. We'd know about that

117
00:09:29.321 --> 00:09:32.921
because it impacts everyone. These are public world
movies. capturing events that grip the attention of the

118
00:09:32.921 --> 00:09:38.425
In the public world context. there exist private realms
where minor tales unfold. impacting solely an

119
00:09:38.425 --> 00:09:43.983
individual's life and intimate relationships; these
secrets remain hidden from even their most trusted

120
00:09:43.983 --> 00:09:44.692
confidants.

121
00:09:44.692 --> 00:09:50.380
For instance. adel's life is like a private world film
or a secret bubble film. where the events are

122
00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:56.181
obscured. and we may never fully understand them
because the character is confined within a particular

123
00:09:56.181 --> 00:09:57.092
reality system. This encapsulation creates a narrative
that remains enigmatic and elusive.

124
00:09:57.092 --> 00:10:04.122
that keeps it contained. similar to the film Get Out.
where a character is ensnared in a sort of hidden

125
00:10:04.122 --> 00:10:04.942
bubble. unable to break free from its confines.

126
00:10:06.288 --> 00:10:12.084
with their girlfriend’s family and within a secret
bubble. Is your film in a private world. secret bubble.

127
00:10:12.084 --> 00:10:17.188
public world context? That’s what I always ask in my
project. Regarding reality. i ask about the

128
00:10:17.188 --> 00:10:19.688
verisimilitude level

129
00:10:19.688 --> 00:10:20.818
that this movie has.

130
00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:27.259
What I'm describing is a realistic film with the native
laws of the physical universe. where there's time.

131
00:10:27.259 --> 00:10:31.305
where there are tables. where there are lights. Or it's
a film of altered reality.

132
00:10:31.305 --> 00:10:36.285
When discussing altered reality. we identify three
types: magical reality. like in Harry Potter; science

133
00:10:36.285 --> 00:10:41.265
fiction reality. which can be biological sci-fi like
The Fly; or physical sci-fi like Avengers.

134
00:10:41.265 --> 00:10:47.496
Which movie would you choose: one set in a physically
possible world like the Marvel Cinematic Universe. but

135
00:10:47.496 --> 00:10:52.517
with significant alterations from our reality. or an
outright supernatural tale such as The Conjuring?

136
00:10:52.517 --> 00:10:58.612
or it might be a realistic film. where within the realm
of reality. a style of realism is applied. which

137
00:10:58.612 --> 00:11:01.777
could be gothic or expressionist in nature. offering a
unique perspective.

138
00:11:01.777 --> 00:11:06.886
it could be a film noir movie. steeped in its unique
reality codes. or a documentary-style film where events

139
00:11:06.886 --> 00:11:11.853
unfold on screen that would never transpire in everyday
life. yet we accept them as true. For example. in

140
00:11:11.853 --> 00:11:14.455
romantic comedies. situations arise that

141
00:11:14.455 --> 00:11:20.009
someone runs through an airport and tells a crowd to
tell someone they love them. and the crowd responds.

142
00:11:20.009 --> 00:11:25.775
acting like a messenger. but in reality. it doesn't
happen. Well. that's the reality of cinema. and there's

143
00:11:25.775 --> 00:11:26.675
guy

144
00:11:26.675 --> 00:11:33.351
of reality or adapting to it. especially in American
romantic comedies. There's a style of naturalistic

145
00:11:33.351 --> 00:11:40.027
cinema like René Man's. where reality is starkly
concrete and profoundly influences the character. This

146
00:11:40.027 --> 00:11:41.259
approach contrasts with the often exaggerated scenarios
typical in romantic comedies.

147
00:11:41.259 --> 00:11:47.266
We also encounter hyperrealism levels. Remember the
Blair Witch Project? Such projects create a direct

148
00:11:47.266 --> 00:11:52.722
connection through a recording system. like a camera.
making the film seem realistic yet inevitably

149
00:11:52.722 --> 00:11:53.219
unrealistic. simulating reality entirely.

150
00:11:53.219 --> 00:11:59.857
That makes the movie inevitably unrealistic. as it
tries to completely simulate reality. Ultimately. this

151
00:11:59.857 --> 00:12:06.495
places the film in a world that is merely plausible. In
the grand scheme of things. movies like these can

152
00:12:06.495 --> 00:12:08.519
exist within their own separate universe. distinct from
our own.

153
00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:15.380
like Terry Gilliam's Brazil. star Wars. or Game of
Thrones. each serves as an example of an alternate

154
00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:16.739
universe. distinct from our own. yet intricately
crafted.

155
00:12:17.299 --> 00:12:22.614
present. future. or past. or if this happens in this
universe. And if the movies happen in this universe.

156
00:12:22.614 --> 00:12:27.929
they can be movies of the past. movies of the present.
or movies of the future. Understanding the time in

157
00:12:27.929 --> 00:12:33.649
which this movie takes place and the level of the
universe also gives us insights to write our story.

158
00:12:35.189 --> 00:12:38.683
Finally. a classification like this helps in
approaching a film.

159
00:12:39.502 --> 00:12:45.969
In the end... But also at the beginning. And at the
beginning. it asks the key questions that make you sit

160
00:12:45.969 --> 00:12:51.902
a table. reflect. and say. "Actually. this film comes
from this planet." Each of them. each of these

161
00:12:51.902 --> 00:12:53.149
elements.

162
00:12:53.149 --> 00:12:58.661
It establishes the parameters and addresses the crucial
issue of which universe is being depicted. delving

163
00:12:58.661 --> 00:13:03.289
into its origins while jotting down observations in a
notebook. writing script. or coding process

164
00:13:03.289 --> 00:13:08.721
for the script folder. everything discovered. Okay. now
let's see in the script folder

165
00:13:09.473 --> 00:13:12.150
How do I fill out the classification of a story?

166
00:13:12.732 --> 00:13:18.882
I've made some progress on the story and have a new
title. Some elements are still in flux. while others

167
00:13:18.882 --> 00:13:24.236
more settled. like Turbulence. in Transit. ten Thousand
Feet. feet on the Ground. and For Journey. These

168
00:13:24.376 --> 00:13:29.852
Aerial disasters. titles that might not last long. but
for now. i'll show them to you. They're there.

169
00:13:29.852 --> 00:13:31.046
existing for the moment. awaiting their fate.

170
00:13:31.663 --> 00:13:36.512
The first summary of the story. i've also been working
a bit more to develop it. I'm going to read it to you

171
00:13:36.512 --> 00:13:41.047
because it's important for us to see the story's
features. Miguel. 29. is a biologist specializing in

172
00:13:41.047 --> 00:13:45.313
studying bacteria that live in extreme conditions like
Antarctica.

173
00:13:45.483 --> 00:13:50.608
The problem is that he'll never be able to travel
because he's afraid of flying. It's a real phobia. In

174
00:13:50.608 --> 00:13:55.685
eccentric center where they offer therapy to overcome
the fear of planes. he meets Antonia. She's a woman

175
00:13:55.685 --> 00:14:00.810
slightly older than him who is moving to New Zealand
and also suffers from a fear of flying. They meet and

176
00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:01.439
share the unusual therapy.

177
00:14:01.439 --> 00:14:07.139
which incorporates a flight simulation cabin. visits to
airports. and an actual flight with therapists. Over

178
00:14:07.139 --> 00:14:12.418
the five-week program. miguel will experience the
sensation of having flown numerous hours. enduring

179
00:14:12.418 --> 00:14:18.172
simulated turbulence alongside Antonia. He will ponder
whether she could have been his ideal partner. as they

180
00:14:18.172 --> 00:14:19.439
navigate this unique therapy together.

181
00:14:19.439 --> 00:14:24.602
In any case. he knows the future of the relationship is
highly unlikely. because once they overcome their

182
00:14:24.602 --> 00:14:25.389
fear of flying.

183
00:14:27.346 --> 00:14:33.253
and they will inevitably drift apart. Well. that's the
summary of the story. Notice how it changed a bit from

184
00:14:33.253 --> 00:14:35.151
what we wrote in the previous session.

185
00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.204
The structures are 3

186
00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:40.210
acts.

187
00:14:40.656 --> 00:14:47.291
with loss. Because in the end. in these three acts. we
will end with the character not achieving what they

188
00:14:47.291 --> 00:14:50.985
wanted. But really. when someone loses in a system.

189
00:14:51.045 --> 00:14:58.504
there can also be a gain of another kind. Naturally.
we'll add more later. This understanding reveals a

190
00:15:00.179 --> 00:15:02.934
which is the understanding that the character...

191
00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:05.020
by going through these three acts

192
00:15:05.435 --> 00:15:11.297
He lost but ultimately gained something. We see three
acts of loss: in the first act. he's down. then rises.

193
00:15:11.297 --> 00:15:11.840
meets Antonia. and loses her.

194
00:15:12.545 --> 00:15:20.200
The character rises. meets Antonia. but loses her. or
the chance of unrequited love. then finds an

195
00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:25.981
opportunity to excel in another life area. The format
is a feature film. structured in three acts of loss and

196
00:15:27.531 --> 00:15:29.401
The temporal design is

197
00:15:29.803 --> 00:15:30.433
with

198
00:15:31.672 --> 00:15:34.816
Meaning I'm telling this story in an orderly.
chronological way.

199
00:15:35.611 --> 00:15:37.961
It's a protagonist narrator. told by Miguel.

200
00:15:43.197 --> 00:15:44.559
is the point

201
00:15:47.048 --> 00:15:47.758
of

202
00:15:48.319 --> 00:15:48.949
view

203
00:15:49.752 --> 00:15:50.382
only

204
00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:52.327
and him

205
00:15:52.966 --> 00:15:54.016
happens

206
00:15:56.646 --> 00:15:57.376
the story.

207
00:15:58.762 --> 00:16:04.409
As you can see. this is a thoughtful piece reflecting
on the history we're creating together. I plan to spend

208
00:16:04.409 --> 00:16:07.467
some time working on it and will let you know once it's
complete.

209
00:16:08.875 --> 00:16:13.872
I have just completed outlining the story's features up
to this point. As previously mentioned. these

210
00:16:13.872 --> 00:16:19.266
elements can change multiple times. and we can adjust
certain criteria. However. for now. we have a three-act

211
00:16:19.266 --> 00:16:21.939
structure that focuses on themes of loss and its
impact.

212
00:16:21.939 --> 00:16:26.854
feature-length format. continuous temporal design.
meaning it's told in order and chronologically. The

213
00:16:26.854 --> 00:16:32.781
narrator is the protagonist narrator. miguel telling.
with the single perspective he's experiencing.

214
00:16:33.782 --> 00:16:38.744
Regarding the characters. the main conflict is
Miguel's. which is circumstantial. Miguel is in love

215
00:16:38.744 --> 00:16:43.849
Antonia. but whatever therapy concludes. she will
follow. The internal conflict is that Miguel is afraid

216
00:16:43.849 --> 00:16:45.949
flying and must fly.

217
00:16:47.037 --> 00:16:51.655
Miguel doesn’t believe in love. yet finds the right
person despite himself. Relational conflict.

218
00:16:51.997 --> 00:16:53.355
Antonia is married.

219
00:16:53.813 --> 00:16:55.808
And Miguel. Is ending things with his ex.

220
00:16:56.171 --> 00:17:02.925
But his ex isn't ready to end things and wants
relationship therapy. This is common; revisiting.

221
00:17:02.925 --> 00:17:09.744
breakup with his ex isn't just relational conflict.
When another person opposes the protagonist's dramatic

222
00:17:09.744 --> 00:17:12.704
vector. we'll delve deeper into this in the future.
exploring how these dynamics unfold and affect the

223
00:17:12.704 --> 00:17:18.794
it has a dramatic vector opposing the protagonist's.
This is common; you write something and feel uncertain.

224
00:17:18.794 --> 00:17:21.953
doubting its quality. This happens frequently in the
creative process.

225
00:17:22.517 --> 00:17:26.880
My advice: it's better to have something bad on paper
than good in your head.

226
00:17:27.988 --> 00:17:34.467
Just write it. You can always change it later. If it's
not good. it will disappear. but if it has potential.

227
00:17:34.467 --> 00:17:35.307
it will eventually come back to you.

228
00:17:36.083 --> 00:17:41.005
Made a note here; under other circumstances. they might
have been a great couple. we’ll never know; fearing

229
00:17:41.005 --> 00:17:46.893
flying. not exactly the wild and brave. actually quite
cowardly. and that's a big problem.

230
00:17:47.534 --> 00:17:53.337
The central argument revolves around the universal
theme of discovering love. The narrative unfolds within

231
00:17:53.337 --> 00:17:58.484
the intimate worlds of Miguel and Antonia. each
experiencing their own private journey in this personal

232
00:17:59.129 --> 00:18:05.171
Regarding verisimilitude. it's a realistic.
naturalistic romantic comedy. Set in a universe that

233
00:18:05.981 --> 00:18:12.449
This universe is set in present-day Chile. specifically
in 2020. within an urban and wintry environment. The

234
00:18:12.449 --> 00:18:17.001
tone reflects our current world. which is heavily
influenced by virtual relationships. shaping how we

235
00:18:17.001 --> 00:18:22.903
transitory and volatile. and in full transformation.
everyone migrates. but some people feel they don't fit

236
00:18:22.903 --> 00:18:27.869
in. We're talking about an urban romantic drama with a
teenage and adult audience.

237
00:18:27.869 --> 00:18:33.711
I believe it is essential to delve into the realm of
fleeting connections and grasp the true symbolism

238
00:18:33.711 --> 00:18:39.500
individuals who hesitate to take flight or yearn for
it. There remains so much to uncover in this narrative.

239
00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:42.448
which makes our exploration all the more captivating.
We are embarking on a profound journey.

240
00:18:42.448 --> 00:18:48.550
However. this path now includes a parameter and a
framework. In the upcoming lesson. i'll discuss the DNA

241
00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:51.488
a screenwriter's craft. focusing on the fundamental
elements of the plot.
