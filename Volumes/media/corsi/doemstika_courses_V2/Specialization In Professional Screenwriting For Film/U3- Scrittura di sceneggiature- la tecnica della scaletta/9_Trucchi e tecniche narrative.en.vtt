00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.520
Narrative tricks and techniques

2
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.103
In this lesson I will explain
some tricks and narrative techniques

3
00:00:12.337 --> 00:00:14.587
that can help you
complete your outline.

4
00:00:15.137 --> 00:00:16.900
We already have the viewer in mind

5
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.420
and we can think about
how to make our scheme

6
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.800
more interesting to him.

7
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.040
We started with a scene of a
mother and her son on the beach,

8
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.638
a man was choking and
the boy wanted to save him.

9
00:00:26.638 --> 00:00:29.000
A handsome man appeared
claiming to be a doctor,

10
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.190
saved the man, and the mother
looked at the child with contempt.

11
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.650
After the credits,
this would be the teaser,

12
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.100
before the story begins,
we saw an interrogation room

13
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.540
where a police officer asks Manuel how
he managed to infiltrate the hospital.

14
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.620
What we will see from there
Manuel tells us from the police station.

15
00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:51.905
Manuel moves suspiciously
around the emergency door,

16
00:00:51.907 --> 00:00:54.127
manages to sneak in
when an ambulance arrives,

17
00:00:54.447 --> 00:00:55.790
goes through the corridors,

18
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.060
he goes into a doctor's
office, he puts on a gown there.

19
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.680
A patient enters.

20
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.440
She has to pretend to him and
make him think that he is a doctor.

21
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.040
Then, when he manages
to get rid of the patient,

22
00:01:07.587 --> 00:01:11.510
he sees a woman walking down
the hall and back into the office.

23
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.180
The woman enters the
office and goes to the closet.

24
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.438
We suspect that
Manuel is hiding inside,

25
00:01:16.787 --> 00:01:18.707
but surprise, it's not in the closet.

26
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.600
Then the camera pans and
we see that he's on the ledge

27
00:01:23.602 --> 00:01:24.652
hanging as it can,

28
00:01:24.653 --> 00:01:26.617
waiting there for the doctor to leave.

29
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.860
Finally we had that in the
operating room he will be with pliers

30
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.030
and they will find out.

31
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.260
We'll have to close by going
back to the interrogation room.

32
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.290
where Manuel will finish his
story or give the conclusion

33
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.760
or we will know what has happened,
if it has killed a sick person or what,

34
00:01:42.762 --> 00:01:45.530
because we know that
Manuel is a mobster.

35
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.083
We have that approach.

36
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.250
do the same as me

37
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.680
and review the plot you
build from time to time

38
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.210
to see if there is any error.

39
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.520
Now we will try to complete the scheme

40
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.770
thinking about what a
narrative step is for.

41
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.943
The fundamental
function of a narrative step

42
00:02:00.945 --> 00:02:02.300
is to advance the plot.

43
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.180
Think about if your
plot advances, if it stops,

44
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.570
if it goes slow, if it goes fast.

45
00:02:06.572 --> 00:02:08.653
Maybe you should
remove some narrative step.

46
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.120
I will remove some
unnecessary narrative step.

47
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.020
I have two narrative steps of
Manuel walking through the corridors.

48
00:02:15.022 --> 00:02:16.222
I will remove one of them.

49
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.080
If it were a feature film,
those two steps could be interesting.

50
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.660
But as it is the scheme
of steps of a short film,

51
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.710
we can remember what the great
Cuban filmmaker Eliseo Altunaga said:

52
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.710
"A short film is an arrow
that goes straight to the heart."

53
00:02:34.435 --> 00:02:37.880
Another function of a narrative
step is to introduce a character.

54
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.010
You can think of presenting a
character in a more interesting way.

55
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.657
In my schematic I have a
character that is useless

56
00:02:46.658 --> 00:02:49.130
more than for Manuel
to enter the hospital.

57
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.520
Let's give him a role.

58
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.730
He is the patient who
comes with the ambulance.

59
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.190
Let's make this character a mob boss.

60
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.620
I will say that this
character is a mafia boss

61
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.010
rival of Manuel's band, but I
will do it in a cinematographic way.

62
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.097
Remember that advice that says:
"Cinema should show, not explain."

63
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.677
So that it is known
that he is a mafia boss,

64
00:03:07.678 --> 00:03:09.555
I will show it as follows.

65
00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:11.690
When the ambulance arrives

66
00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.028
We will see that the patient is
handcuffed and that two policemen are watching him.

67
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:18.710
We put it here.

68
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.710
Narrative passages also work

69
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.320
to convey basic
information to the viewer,

70
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.440
so that the viewer is
interested in what we are telling.

71
00:03:28.442 --> 00:03:31.232
This transmission of
information is called exposure.

72
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.823
If you don't give the viewer
information, they won't be interested.

73
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.740
I will tell something more about
this patient handcuffed mob boss.

74
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.640
To meet this character, I will
introduce a new narrative step

75
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.810
which will be in the
patient room of this mobster.

76
00:03:49.812 --> 00:03:50.938
We put it here.

77
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.900
The patient is with the two
police officers who monitor him

78
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.560
and on television they are
giving news of a shooting.

79
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.510
The patient says, "I'm on TV."

80
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.970
This says a lot about the patient.

81
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.380
is almost dying

82
00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.320
and yet he appears on TV and
wants to see himself no matter what.

83
00:04:07.322 --> 00:04:10.380
Now I will tell the
viewer who this man is.

84
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.820
We put a tab here.

85
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.860
We move everything around a
bit and put a new tab here.

86
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:21.480
Is that on
television, after a shooting,

87
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.560
they say "Edu el
palentino was seriously wounded".

88
00:04:25.562 --> 00:04:29.072
This is where we discover that
the man from Palencia is our patient.

89
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.868
To add more narrative steps,

90
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.500
you can ask yourself questions
and answer them with narrative steps.

91
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.290
What does my protagonist want?

92
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:38.940
What's your objective?

93
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.400
Manuel's objective will
be to kill Edu el Palencia.

94
00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.390
I add a new file where
we put that on television

95
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.418
They say that they are looking for the
aggressor of Edu el Palencia, the one who shot him,

96
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.280
who is Manu the
Leonese, who is our Manuel.

97
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.920
another question you can ask

98
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.493
it is what weaknesses the
characters have, what difficulties they face.

99
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.400
We have already seen that Manuel

100
00:05:03.402 --> 00:05:06.900
he will have to pretend to a
sick person that he is a doctor

101
00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.960
and that after a little he is saved

102
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.445
that the woman who enters
the consultation sees it.

103
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.530
I could add some revelation for
my character and find out something.

104
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:17.760
Think about your scheme

105
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.440
Let's see if you can also
find something that happens to it,

106
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.902
having to deal with a problem, etc.

107
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.188
It could be that the outcome was
positive and you changed it to negative

108
00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:29.220
Or otherwise.

109
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.830
In my case, I already
changed the original news

110
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.220
and I made Manuel a mobster.

111
00:05:34.222 --> 00:05:36.300
But why make so many changes?

112
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.670
Why change everything over and over?

113
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.597
One of the most important
reasons is that if you change,

114
00:05:42.597 --> 00:05:44.210
you are doing something original.

115
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.640
However, if your step
scheme is not modified,

116
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.700
then surely you're remembering

117
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.032
something you saw last
week or a few years ago

118
00:05:54.032 --> 00:05:55.260
and not creating something new.

119
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.800
Writers should listen to intuition

120
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.120
in the early stages,

121
00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.920
but then we must put it to the
test to surprise the spectators.

122
00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:05.970
We must go further.

123
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.840
We don't have to think about
the viewer's first intuition,

124
00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.750
but go to the second
intuition, to the third, to the fourth,

125
00:06:12.988 --> 00:06:17.248
so that what we tell is
surprising for the spectators.

126
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.650
I'll change the ending again.

127
00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.320
I will make Manuel not be a mobster.

128
00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.907
I'll make the viewer
believe it for a while,

129
00:06:24.907 --> 00:06:28.450
but in the end I will reveal
that he is actually a policeman.

130
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.090
It's been quite a radical change.

131
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.400
so I have to check that
something is not wrong.

132
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.245
With the passing of the
interrogation at the police station

133
00:06:38.245 --> 00:06:39.290
No problem.

134
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.660
They ask Manuel how he
got into the hospital.

135
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.220
The viewer suspects that he is a mobster
and will later discover that he is a policeman.

136
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.340
We'll just have to be
careful when we write the scene

137
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.755
is that he is seen in the
foreground and the police uniform is not seen.

138
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.580
The narrative step
that I must change is this,

139
00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:58.740
when they say that they are looking
for the aggressor, Manu the Leonese,

140
00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:03.600
because it won't be our
Manuel, it won't be any gangster.

141
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:08.135
We remove it and replace it
because what they actually say

142
00:07:08.135 --> 00:07:11.755
is: "It is feared that they
want to attack the palentino",

143
00:07:12.117 --> 00:07:15.213
who want to attack
again in the hospital.

144
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.630
With this new plot there are two
tabs that no longer make much sense.

145
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.230
One is the operating room.

146
00:07:22.232 --> 00:07:26.462
Manuel about to use the pliers
and discovered in the operating room.

147
00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.750
Since we already know that
Manuel is a policeman, not a mobster,

148
00:07:29.752 --> 00:07:30.885
we remove them.

149
00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:33.920
But we have a new problem.

150
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.408
If Manuel is not a
mobster, but a policeman,

151
00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:41.135
Who wants to attack Edu el Palencia?

152
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.200
Let's see it with three of
the best narrative tricks,

153
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.900
suspense, anticipation and surprise.

154
00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.260
It seems that things
are falling into place.

155
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:53.930
We put these two tabs in place.

156
00:07:54.157 --> 00:07:55.518
Everything seems to be going well.

157
00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.813
The suspense was already there when
Manuel sees the woman in the hallway,

158
00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:02.170
he hides and the
woman enters the office.

159
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:04.400
The expectation and anticipation,

160
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.720
when the woman goes to
the closet and opens it.

161
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:11.868
The viewer fears that the
woman will discover Manuel,

162
00:08:11.868 --> 00:08:14.540
but surprise, Manuel
is not in the closet.

163
00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:19.070
That's when we discover
that Manuel is on the ledge,

164
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:20.323
holding on as best he can.

165
00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:23.100
I will add a double surprise.

166
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.908
Let's go back to the moment in which
we assume that Manuel is in the closet

167
00:08:26.908 --> 00:08:28.950
when the woman enters the consultation.

168
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:32.970
We remove the token of the
surprise that Manuel is not in the closet.

169
00:08:32.972 --> 00:08:34.748
We withdraw that the woman leaves.

170
00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:38.550
We remove them to
replace them with others.

171
00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.190
The first will be that
the woman opens the closet,

172
00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.095
but we won't see the inside yet.

173
00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:47.888
Now we discover that
Manuel is on the ledge hanging,

174
00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:50.040
but we don't know yet
what's in the closet.

175
00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.700
Now we find out what's inside.

176
00:08:51.702 --> 00:08:53.550
It is not empty and
Manuel is not there.

177
00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:56.250
What there is is a
woman bound and gagged.

178
00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:00.120
The woman who has entered the
consultation, smiles and closes the cupboard.

179
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.363
Then we discover that
Manuel is hanging from the ledge,

180
00:09:03.363 --> 00:09:04.473
trying to hold on

181
00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:10.010
As this entire scheme of steps will
be in the tone of a very crazy comedy,

182
00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:12.650
we will have to play
when writing the scene

183
00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:15.620
in which Manuel, when he
is holding on to the ledge

184
00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:17.510
and looks in
astonishment towards the closet,

185
00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:19.700
almost fell when
discovering what's inside,

186
00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.500
a bound and gagged woman.

187
00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.870
Now we know who wants to kill Edu.

188
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:28.140
It is a false doctor, the
woman who entered the consultation.

189
00:09:28.307 --> 00:09:29.463
so that the viewer

190
00:09:29.463 --> 00:09:33.360
know who is the woman
tied inside the closet,

191
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.410
we will put one more narrative step,
which is when we are in the emergency room,

192
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:40.530
together with the nurses,
the patient and the policemen,

193
00:09:40.532 --> 00:09:42.050
There is also a doctor.

194
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.260
What I did is called
sowing or "planting".

195
00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.040
It's about giving
small clues so that later,

196
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.580
when the viewer sees
the outcome, accept it.

197
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.600
Since the spectator has
seen that a doctor is going

198
00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.550
with the nurses and the patient in
the emergency room at the beginning,

199
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:29.540
when the closet opens,
it's not just any woman,

200
00:10:29.542 --> 00:10:32.362
It is the doctor that we have seen
before entering the emergency room.

201
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:36.920
Keep in mind that it is almost
always better to give up telling everything

202
00:10:37.158 --> 00:10:39.678
and let the viewer be
the one to connect the dots.

203
00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.968
That is precisely what my favorite
director, Ernst Lubitsch, used to say.

204
00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.940
Yes, Lubitsch, the one in the painting.

205
00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.800
The great director and
screenwriter Billy Wilder

206
00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.320
He had a painting
like this in his office.

207
00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.110
Billy Wilder had worked
with him and adored him.

208
00:10:56.497 --> 00:10:58.000
When Wilder was making a script,

209
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.643
from time to time he looked at the
painting where it said "how would Lubitsch do it?"

210
00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:03.400
and then it said:

211
00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:06.850
"Perhaps what I am writing
is not worthy of my master."

212
00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.210
One of Lubitsch's tips
that Wilder always applied

213
00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:11.410
is the one that says:

214
00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:15.670
"Don't tell the viewer that 2 + 2 = 4.

215
00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:18.640
It is best if you tell the viewer '2'

216
00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:23.290
and later you tell him
'2' and let him do the sum".

217
00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.690
That advice is always applied at Pixar.

218
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.410
Going back to my scheme,

219
00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:31.830
instead of explaining how the
fake doctor has replaced the other,

220
00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:35.163
put her in a closet,
tied her up and gagged her,

221
00:11:35.423 --> 00:11:39.073
what we do is show the
doctor at the beginning

222
00:11:39.073 --> 00:11:42.860
in the emergency room when the ambulance
comes in, and then show it in the closet.

223
00:11:42.862 --> 00:11:46.012
With this the viewer already
knows that this was the real doctor

224
00:11:46.013 --> 00:11:50.760
and that the one who put her in the closet is
the one who wants to kill the man from Palencia.

225
00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:53.370
And not only that, in this closet scene

226
00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:57.030
It is also suggested that Manuel is not the
one who wanted to kill the man from Palencia,

227
00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:58.110
he is not a mobster.

228
00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:59.478
So who is Manuel?

229
00:12:00.018 --> 00:12:03.000
The viewer does not yet
know the narrative step

230
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.040
where we find out he's a cop.

231
00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.300
We already have a
story here, several scenes,

232
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.580
a bit of crazy, crazy comedy,

233
00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:15.213
in the style of Mel Brooks,
in the style of Gene Wilder,

234
00:12:15.682 --> 00:12:18.520
or that of Blake Edwards
from "The Pink Panther".

235
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:21.180
Now we have in this scheme of steps

236
00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:23.760
several questions that the viewer asks.

237
00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.770
Will Edu die from Palencia?

238
00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:29.630
Will the doctor
achieve her sinister purposes?

239
00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:33.150
Will Manuel manage to prevent
Edu el Palencia from being killed?

240
00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.260
If the viewer wonders that,
great, you've created suspense.

241
00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:41.040
Of course, you will have to
answer those questions later.

242
00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.800
That is what is called
"pay off", pay off debts.

243
00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.797
I will pay my first debt.

244
00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:50.080
We will see if this false doctor
manages to kill the man from Palencia or not.

245
00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.880
I will add a new narrative step.

246
00:12:52.068 --> 00:12:56.430
The false doctor prepares
to anesthetize the palentino

247
00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:57.600
and kill him, it is assumed.

248
00:12:57.930 --> 00:12:59.280
He looks at her terrified.

249
00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.450
He has recognized her.

250
00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:07.170
It is in a moment of tension.

251
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:10.437
Will the false doctor be able
to kill the man from Palencia?

252
00:13:11.187 --> 00:13:14.630
To build a step scheme we
have to continually change.

253
00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:16.730
We have to modify, destroy,

254
00:13:16.732 --> 00:13:20.060
add a narrative step that was not
there, remove another that was there.

255
00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:23.260
I have to admit that I
simplified the process,

256
00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:24.610
'Cause if I made it real

257
00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:27.340
With all the destruction and
the change of tokens that there is,

258
00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:30.820
this would be crazy and I
couldn't follow the creative process.

259
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:33.760
However, you have to be very demanding,

260
00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:35.680
change chips, put others,

261
00:13:35.682 --> 00:13:38.162
turn the story upside down

262
00:13:38.163 --> 00:13:41.493
abandon everything you
believed in and adopt another idea.

263
00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.740
Next, we'll continue to
think like a screenwriter,

264
00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:46.600
this time sequentially.
